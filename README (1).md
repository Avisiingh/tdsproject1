# GitHub User and Repository Data from Chennai

## Summary
- This project involved scraping GitHub's API to gather information about users located in Chennai with over 50 followers, along with their public repositories.
- One surprising fact was that many users had a significantly higher number of followers than public repositories, indicating a potential lack of contributions.
- Developers are encouraged to actively contribute to open source projects to enhance their visibility and engage with the community.

## Files
- `users.csv`: Contains user data from GitHub.
- `repositories.csv`: Contains public repository data for each user.
